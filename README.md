## Last time:

Recap: "State Aware Function Composition"

## What can we actually do with it?

(AFsharpShowcase)
C:\Users\ronal\source\repos\github.VideCollabo\AFSharpShowcase\Vide4Avalonia
* Vide.Avalonia: Show Counter
* Vide.Avalonia: Refactor Counter
* Vide.Avalonia: Show TodoList
    For-Loops


(Vide Solution)
* But also: Vide.Fable
* Todo List
* Quick overview of other use cases
    C:\Users\ronal\source\repos\github.videCollabo\Vide\Vide.UI\Vide.UI.Fable\src\DevApp\src\UseCases

(Vide Solution)
* Roll your own: Show Avalonia implementation

(Vide Solution)
* Vide.DSP
    C:\Users\ronal\source\repos\github.videCollabo\Vide\Vide.Audio\Vide.Dsp.DiscreteTime.Tests.ipynb
    C:\Users\ronal\source\repos\github.videCollabo\Vide\Vide.Audio\Vide.Audio.NAudio\src\Vide.Audio.NAudio\playbackTest.fsx


## How does it work?

* UiElements is the state
* or: The Promise is the state


## Facts

* Zero Dependencies
* Lightweight: "Hook-in" everywhere in your application
* Universal: Not bound to a specific framework
* Can be mixed with other concepts like Promise/Async/etc. and provide a use case centered API for such cases
* Immutability at it's core; open for mutability when required
* No dependencies: No need to install a specific framework
* Fable and dotnet
* Easy to adapt to other domains
* Idiomatic: Uses known language constructs as much as possible
* Doesn't hide the underlying technology; access is always possible
* Fast?
